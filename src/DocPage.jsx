            The aim is to help you create, craft, and crochet! <br/>
            I created this page as a way to brainstorm and hopefully <br/>
            create something fun and cuddly! <br/>
            I began crocheting in 2023 and have loved it ever since. <br/>
            <div className = "pt-6">
            Through creating fun amigurumi characters with a twist I hope <br/>
            to inspire you through your crochet journey!</div>
